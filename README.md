# The-Base-Rate-Fallacy
The first problem we encounter in the project is the conditional probability. This problem consists in two events A and B defined over some sample space. Consider a case that the two events are related in a way that, the probability of one of them depends on whether the other event has occurred, and for this reason it would be the term of conditional probability. The purpose is to simulate the rolling of two fair dice and obtain estimates of conditional probabilities under different scenarios using the computer to compute it. In the second problem of the project was the Base Rate Fallacy in which we use the notion of conditional probability to examine the so-called base rate fallacy. The base rate fallacy is an error that occurs when the conditional probability of some hypothesis H, given some evidence E, is assessed without taking sufficient account of the base rate  or prior probability of HÂ²
